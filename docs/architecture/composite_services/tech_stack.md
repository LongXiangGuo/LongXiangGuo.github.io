# Composite Services Tech Stack

Our composite servicese are built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

## Why NestJS

A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

**Extensible**: Gives you true flexibility by allowing use of any other libraries thanks to modular architecture.

**Versatile**: An adaptable ecosystem that is a fully-fledged backbone for all kinds of server-side applications.

**Progressive**: Takes advantage of latest JavaScript features, bringing design patterns and mature solutions to node.js world.

## Can I use something else?

While we understand each team has their own familiarity with programming languages and frameworks, we believe standardizing the composite services allows for a scalable, adaptable and overall better experience. If all composites are written in the same language, it allows for multiple teams to add and/or support a composite. We encourage teams to look at using TypeScript and NestJS and try it out.
