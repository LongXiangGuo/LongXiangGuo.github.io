# Onboarding

## Our Vision

Our vision is to create a platform that is **developer friendly, developer scalable** and **performant** which provides **safe experimentation** and **continuos deployment**.

## Our ambition

Our ambition is to be able to regularly release Connected clients across all platforms and all regions simultaneously with the same feature capabilities.

## Developed in Flutter

Connected 2.0 is built on top of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). Flutter is Googleâ€™s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

## Powered by the cloud

While Flutter allows for fast development on the client side, our true power resides on the cloud. Minimizing the amount of work that is put on the clients increases our ability to deliver faster and safer. Our OMC (Open Mobility Cloud) hosts the APIs that feed Connected 2.0. **We believe that the only way to succeed is by having world-class APIs that are robust, reliable, predictable and easy to use**.

## Onboarding topics and templates

The Mobile 2.0 Core Team has identified the following topics to be covered during the onboarding process of a new developer:

- **What is Mobile 2.0? Product, Agile and vision of the project** To be covered by a Product Owner and a Scrum Master
- **Overall architecture: high level client and backend structure** To be covered by an engineer
- **Intro to Flutter: it's all widgets!** To be covered by an engineer
- **The Bloc pattern: benefits, tools and testing** To be covered by an engineer
- **Backend for front-ends** To be covered by an engineer
- **Automation, testing and pipelines** To be covered by an engineer

These topics should be presented within the first **3** days of the new dev joining the team. None of these talks should take longer than 1 hour, and it is ideal if the presenter uses this site as reference. This table represents a recommended timeline:

|           |                             Day 1                             |                     Day 2                     |               Day 3               |
