# BEEP - BMW Evolution and Enhancement Process

Welcome to BEEP, our mechanism to collect ideas that will improve and modify our coding guidelines and standards. BEEP is strongly inspired by [KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP), and it is intended to be a collaboration space where every developer is welcome, her or his ideas are listened and evaluated, and feedback is given.

## How does it work?

Easy, just open a pull request (PR) with your proposed changes. Everyone is welcome to open a proposal. Every proposal will be reviewed and evaluated by the [Core team](https://github-enterprise.daytona-poc.com/orgs/mobile20/teams/mobile-core). The Core team will provide feedback, and should mark the proposal as:

* **Approved** if the proposal is considered to bring positive value and impact to our project or practices, and it is well redacted and documented.
* **Needs work** if the proposal seems to be in the right direction to be considered *Approved*, but it is still lacking information, or the content can be improved.
* **Rejected** if the proposal is considered to not to bring positive impact or improvements to our tools.

Since this is a space for collaboration and improvement, it is very important to:

* Be respectful and kind
* Always look for the common good
* Feedback is always better when it includes examples and alternatives. 

## What should be the content of a proposal?

The document should be written in Markdown format.

A proposal must include the following content:

* Title
* Author(s)
* Summary of the proposal
* Motivation of the proposal
* A more detailed description
* Code examples

With these five pieces, we can ensure that the reviewers have enough context to evaluate the proposal accordingly.
